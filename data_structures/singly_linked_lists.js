// ========= SINGLY LINKED LISTS ========== //

// A data structure that contains a HEAD, TAIL, and LENGTH property
// Linked Lists consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null (like a train with linked cars)
// NO INDEX TO ACCESS THE ELEMENTS (cant ask for the 5th thing)
// basically, starting from the head, a node points to the next one until you reach the end, which doesnt reference anything so its "points" to NULL
